For thesis, look into the folder ucsd-thesis.

1.  template.tex is the main file.
2.  template_frontmatter.tex is the "front matter" file (Title, Signature page,
    abstract etc)
3.  ucsd.cls contains all the styles.
4.  Each chapter has its own tex file.  Figures for each chapter in their own directory.
