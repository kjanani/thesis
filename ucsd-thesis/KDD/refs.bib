  abstract = {Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagnetic
	fields produced by the neural electrical currents. Given a conductor
	model for the head, and the distribution of source currents in the
	brain, Maxwell's equations allow one to compute the ensuing M/EEG
	signals. Given the actual M/EEG measurements and the solution of
	this forward problem, one can localize, in space and in time, the
	brain regions that have produced the recorded data. However, due
	to the physics of the problem, the limited number of sensors compared
	to the number of possible source locations, and measurement noise,
	this inverse problem is ill-posed. Consequently, additional constraints
	are needed. Classical inverse solvers, often called minimum norm
	estimates (MNE), promote source estimates with a small \ell(2) norm.
	Here, we consider a more general class of priors based on mixed norms.
	Such norms have the ability to structure the prior in order to incorporate
	some additional assumptions about the sources. We refer to such solvers
	as mixed-norm estimates (MxNE). In the context of M/EEG, MxNE can
	promote spatially focal sources with smooth temporal estimates with
	a two-level \ell(1)/\ell(2) mixed-norm, while a three-level mixed-norm
	can be used to promote spatially non-overlapping sources between
	different experimental conditions. In order to efficiently solve
	the optimization problems of MxNE, we introduce fast first-order
	iterative schemes that for the \ell(1)\ell(2) norm give solutions
	in a few seconds making such a prior as convenient as the simple
	MNE. Furthermore, thanks to the convexity of the optimization problem,
	we can provide optimality conditions that guarantee global convergence.
	The utility of the methods is demonstrated both with simulations
	and experimental MEG data.},

  abstract = {High-density clusters are defined on a population with density f in
	r dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form {x | f(x) ‚â•
	c}. Single-linkage clustering is evaluated for consistency in detecting
	such high-density clusters-other standard hierarchical techniques,
	such as average and complete linkage, are hopelessly inconsistent
	for these clusters. The asymptotic consistency of single linkage
	closely depends on the percolation problem of Broadbent and Hammersley-if
	small spheres are removed at random from a solid, at which density
	of spheres will water begin to flow through the solid? If there is
	a single critical density such that no flow takes place below a certain
	density, and flow occurs through a single connected set above that
	density, then single linkage is consistent in separating high-density
	clusters (by disjoint single-linkage clusters that include a positive
	fraction of sample points in the respective clusters and pass arbitrarily
	close to all points in the respective clusters). The existence of
	a single critical point remains a conjecture. A weaker result is
	proved that shows that single-linkage clusters detect high-density
	clusters if there is a low enough valley separating them.},

  abstract = {We examine in some detail Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)-
	the dominant features used for speech recognition- and investigate
	their applicability to modeling music. In particular, we examine
	two of the main assumptions of the process of forming MFCCs: the
	use of the Mel frequency scale to model the spectra; and the use
	of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to decorrelate the Mel-spectral
	vectors. We examine the first assumption in the context of speech/music
	discrimination. Our results show that the use of the Mel scale for
	modeling music is at least not harmful for this problem, although
	further experimentation is needed to verify that this is the optimal
	scale in the general case. We investigate the second assumption by
	examining the basis vectors of the theoretically optimal transform
	to decorrelate music and speech spectral vectors. Our results demonstrate
	that the use of the DCT to decorrelate vectors is appropriate for
	both speech and music spectra.},

	naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance
	problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of
	selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the
	accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the
	LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection.
	The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently
	proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual
	variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions
	of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions
	give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination
	method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and
	the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples
	are used to illustrate the methods.}},

abstract ={PNAS is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific journals. The PNAS official classification structure of subjects is reflected in topic labels submitted by the authors of articles, largely related to traditionally established disciplines. These include broad field classifications into physical sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, and further subtopic classifications within the fields. Focusing on biological sciences, we explore an internal soft-classification structure of articles based only on semantic decompositions of abstracts and bibliographies and compare it with the formal discipline classifications. Our model assumes that there is a fixed number of internal categories, each characterized by multinomial distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in bibliographies). Soft classification for each article is based on proportions of the article's content coming from each category. We discuss the appropriateness of the model for the PNAS database as well as other features of the data relevant to soft classification.},

  abstract = {Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagnetic
	fields produced by the neural electrical currents. Given a conductor
	model for the head, and the distribution of source currents in the
	brain, Maxwell's equations allow one to compute the ensuing M/EEG
	signals. Given the actual M/EEG measurements and the solution of
	this forward problem, one can localize, in space and in time, the
	brain regions that have produced the recorded data. However, due
	to the physics of the problem, the limited number of sensors compared
	to the number of possible source locations, and measurement noise,
	this inverse problem is ill-posed. Consequently, additional constraints
	are needed. Classical inverse solvers, often called minimum norm
	estimates (MNE), promote source estimates with a small \ell(2) norm.
	Here, we consider a more general class of priors based on mixed norms.
	Such norms have the ability to structure the prior in order to incorporate
	some additional assumptions about the sources. We refer to such solvers
	as mixed-norm estimates (MxNE). In the context of M/EEG, MxNE can
	promote spatially focal sources with smooth temporal estimates with
	a two-level \ell(1)/\ell(2) mixed-norm, while a three-level mixed-norm
	can be used to promote spatially non-overlapping sources between
	different experimental conditions. In order to efficiently solve
	the optimization problems of MxNE, we introduce fast first-order
	iterative schemes that for the \ell(1)\ell(2) norm give solutions
	in a few seconds making such a prior as convenient as the simple
	MNE. Furthermore, thanks to the convexity of the optimization problem,
	we can provide optimality conditions that guarantee global convergence.
	The utility of the methods is demonstrated both with simulations
	and experimental MEG data.},

  abstract = {High-density clusters are defined on a population with density f in
	r dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form {x | f(x) ‚â•
	c}. Single-linkage clustering is evaluated for consistency in detecting
	such high-density clusters-other standard hierarchical techniques,
	such as average and complete linkage, are hopelessly inconsistent
	for these clusters. The asymptotic consistency of single linkage
	closely depends on the percolation problem of Broadbent and Hammersley-if
	small spheres are removed at random from a solid, at which density
	of spheres will water begin to flow through the solid? If there is
	a single critical density such that no flow takes place below a certain
	density, and flow occurs through a single connected set above that
	density, then single linkage is consistent in separating high-density
	clusters (by disjoint single-linkage clusters that include a positive
	fraction of sample points in the respective clusters and pass arbitrarily
	close to all points in the respective clusters). The existence of
	a single critical point remains a conjecture. A weaker result is
	proved that shows that single-linkage clusters detect high-density
	clusters if there is a low enough valley separating them.},

  abstract = {We examine in some detail Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)-
	the dominant features used for speech recognition- and investigate
	their applicability to modeling music. In particular, we examine
	two of the main assumptions of the process of forming MFCCs: the
	use of the Mel frequency scale to model the spectra; and the use
	of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to decorrelate the Mel-spectral
	vectors. We examine the first assumption in the context of speech/music
	discrimination. Our results show that the use of the Mel scale for
	modeling music is at least not harmful for this problem, although
	further experimentation is needed to verify that this is the optimal
	scale in the general case. We investigate the second assumption by
	examining the basis vectors of the theoretically optimal transform
	to decorrelate music and speech spectral vectors. Our results demonstrate
	that the use of the DCT to decorrelate vectors is appropriate for
	both speech and music spectra.},

  abstract = {{Summary.‚ÄÇ We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables
	(factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises
	naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance
	problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of
	selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the
	accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the
	LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection.
	The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently
	proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual
	variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions
	of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions
	give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination
	method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and
	the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples
	are used to illustrate the methods.}},

abstract ={PNAS is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific journals. The PNAS official classification structure of subjects is reflected in topic labels submitted by the authors of articles, largely related to traditionally established disciplines. These include broad field classifications into physical sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, and further subtopic classifications within the fields. Focusing on biological sciences, we explore an internal soft-classification structure of articles based only on semantic decompositions of abstracts and bibliographies and compare it with the formal discipline classifications. Our model assumes that there is a fixed number of internal categories, each characterized by multinomial distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in bibliographies). Soft classification for each article is based on proportions of the article's content coming from each category. We discuss the appropriateness of the model for the PNAS database as well as other features of the data relevant to soft classification.},
