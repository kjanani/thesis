\section{Introduction}
\noindent Our aim is to develop an algorithm that will effectively analyze and summarize an incoming stream of short texts.
In particular, the algorithm intends to
\begin{itemize}
\item discover what the topics are at each time instant (this is particularly challenging for
short texts, and we will address this issue),
\item identify whether the topics are evolving, emerging or fading,
\item and tell a story based on all the incidents that take place during a given timeframe.
\end{itemize}.
