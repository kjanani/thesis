%\subsection{Digital Disease Detection \& Ebola}
The application of computational methods to social media, news
reports, and 
consumer-generated non-clinical ``big data'' is a rapidly growing area
of research, variously referred to as \emph{digital disease detection}
\cite{Brownstein:2009aa},
\emph{digital epidemiology} \cite{Salathe:2012aa}, and \emph{infodemiology} \cite{Eysenbach:2009aa}, with a focus
both on tracking disease incidence and prevalence (e.g. Google Flu
Trends \cite{Cook:2011aa})
and on the early identification of disease outbreaks (e.g. Healthmap \cite{Freifeld:2008aa},
Biocaster \cite{Collier:2008aa}).   There is now substantial evidence
that Twitter is a valuable resource for some infectious disease
monitoring applications, especially for influenza
\cite{Signorini:2011aa,Collier:2011aa}.
However, 
disease tracking and outbreak detection is just part of the public
health response to an outbreak \cite{Oyeyemi:2014aa}: understanding the strength and duration of public concerns, 
and identifying potential opportunities for health education are
vital, especially in situations where a disease is poorly
understood \cite{SteelFisher:2015aa} by the general public.  
One major reason for this is that the content generated on
microblogging platforms like Twitter
is highly infiltrated with noise (since it is not curated), hence rendering it difficult
for computational/statistical approaches (like topic models) to automatically make inferences
and summarize the content \cite{Rajani:2014, Mehrotra:2013, Hong:2010}.
Although advancements have been made in the area of detection and
identification of events from social media, these contributions
have been more methodical (step-wise procedures) than algorithmic \cite{weng2011event, li2012tedas, becker2011beyond, cataldi2010emerging}.  
While, at the time of an epidemic, what is really needed is a more automatic approach with minimum
human involvement to identify potential areas
intervention from official public health departments from a very high volume
of constantly evolving incoming data.
