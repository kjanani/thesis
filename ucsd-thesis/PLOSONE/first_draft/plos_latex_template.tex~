\section*{Abstract}
On-line social networks publish information about an enormous volume of
  real-world events almost instantly, becoming a primary source
  for breaking news.  Many of the events reported in social media can be of
  high-impact to society, such as important political decisions, natural
  disasters and terrorist actions, but might go unnoticed in their early
  stages due to the overload of other information.  We ask, is it possible to
  clearly and quickly identify which of these news events are going to have
  substantial impact before they actually become a trend in the network?

  We investigate real-world news discussed on Twitter for approximately 1
  year, consisting of $5,234$ news events that are composed of 43 million
  messages.  We show that using just the first 5\% of the events' lifetime
  evolution, we are able to predict with high precision the top 8\% that
  have the most impact.  We observe that events that have high impact present unique
  characteristics in terms of how they are adopted by the network and that
  these qualities are independent of the event's size and scope.  As a
  consequence, high impact news events are naturally filtered by the social
  network, engaging users early on, much before they are brought to
  the mainstream audience.

\section*{Introduction}
%\section{a}

% Motivation
Social media has become a primary source of breaking news information
for millions of users all over the world \cite{Kwak:2010}. On-line
social networks along with mobile internet devices have crowdsourced
the task of disseminating real-time information. As a result, both
news media and news consumers have become inundated with much more
information than they can process. To handle this data overload, it is
important to find ways to quickly filter information that has the
potential of creating an impact on society. Fast identification of
high-impact news events, at both global and local scales, can help
improve information delivery, as well as journalistic coverage and
emergency responses from authorities during crisis situations. We
address this challenge by analyzing the properties of real-world news
events in on-line social networks and present our main findings of how
high-impact events can be clearly identified in the early stages of
their outbreak.

% Brief background on the problem

The study of information propagation on the Web has sparked tremendous
interest in recent years. The literature primarily considers studying
the process through which a {\em meme}, usually a piece of media (like
a video, an image, or a specific Web article), gains popularity
% \cite{Castillo:2014},\cite{Szabo:2010},\cite{Lerman:2010},\cite{Tatar:2011},\cite{Pinto:2013},\cite{Ahmed:2013,
% Zaman_information_spreading},\cite{suh2010want}
\cite{Castillo:2014,Szabo:2010,Lerman:2010,Tatar:2011,Pinto:2013,Ahmed:2013,Zaman_information_spreading,suh2010want}.
Although that research is relevant, it faces two major shortcomings
when it comes to the identification of impactful newsworthy events.
The first limitation is that a meme represents a simple information
unit and its propagation behavior does not correspond necessarily to
that of more complex information such as news events. News events are
usually diffused in the network in many different formats, e.g., a
particular news story such as {\em earthquake in Japan} can be
communicated through images, URLs, tweets, videos, etc. The second
limitation of prior work comes from how the {\em impact} of
information is measured. In scientific research, impact has been
traditionally related to the total amount of attention received by a
subject
\cite{berger2012makes,iribarren2011branching,guerini2011exploring,mills2012virality,gaugaz2012predicting}.
Content in on-line social networks which received
votes/comments/shares above a certain threshold is deemed {\em viral}
or {\em popular}, and therefore having impact. One problem with this
definition is that it does not consider events of different sizes and
scopes, and is biased toward large events. For instance, a global
event with world-wide coverage, such as the death of political leader
Nelson Mandela, is big news because of the volume of social media
posts produced by on-line social networks over a short period of time.
Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this news as high-impact.
Nevertheless, there are events that create high-impact in smaller
on-line communities, such as a particular country (e.g., the
withdrawal of the main right wing presidential candidate in Chile due
to psychiatric problems, just before
elections \cite{chile_elections}.
%\footnote{\url{http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/10188216/Chilean-presidential-candidate-pulls-out-of-election-with-depression.html}
%  (Accessed: August 25, 2015.)}). 
Clearly, local events do not produce
as many social media posts as global events, but do create a very
strong and immediate reaction from users in local networks, and should
also be considered high-impact. Some other types of events, such as
The Oscars, span a long period of time and are discussed by social
network users for weeks or even months. This type of event, when
considered in full, does generate a great volume of social media
posts, but these posts are distributed over time without producing an
immediate reaction from the network's users. All in all, it is evident
that a variety of aspects need to be considered when determining
whether or not an event can be deemed high-impact. Indeed, when
consulting journalists on how news media sources measure the impact of
news, we learn that they too face the issue of not having a clear way
to approach this problem.

% Our contributions

We focus on high-impact news in social media, contributing by (i)
defining a new concise way for measuring information impact, (ii)
determining the existence of unique characteristics that differentiate
how high-impact exogenous events are propagated in the network, and
(iii) show, through the creation of an early prediction model for
high-impact events, that these types of news events are naturally
identified and filtered by the network at very early stages of their
outbreak.



\section*{Materials and Methods}
We define an event as a conglomerate of information that encompasses
all of the social media content related to a real-world news
occurrence. Using this definition, which considers an event as a
complex unit of information, we define an event's impact in terms of
the strength or immediacy of the networks' reaction to the information
about a particular news topic. We define an event's impact on the
community based on the \emph{arrival time intervals} of consecutive
social media posts.
% The \emph{distribution} of the arrival time intervals is studied for
% a given event.
High-impact events are those events for which the \emph{distribution}
of the arrival time intervals between posts is most heavily skewed
towards the smallest possible arrival time interval (zero). In other
words, those events which have posts arriving almost instantaneously
are defined as high-impact. Figure \ref{fig:example_buzz} shows an
example of the distribution of the arrival time intervals of the
events {\em (a) The death of Nelson Mandela} and {\em (b) The Oscars}.

      concentration in the first histogram bin, we conclude that the social media posts
      for this event occur in cascades of quick successions, almost
      instantaneously. The second event, [may, oscar] (\ref{fig:low}) was collected
      on 2014-03-23 discussing The Oscars event that was held a few

% How we did it

We study a dataset of $5,234$ news events gathered from news
headlines from a \emph{manually curated} list of news media
accounts (e.g., @CNN, @BreakingNews, @BBCNews, etc.) in the
microblogging platform Twitter \cite{Twitter_website}
%\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com}
%  (Accessed: August 25, 2015.)} 
(a full list of all the news media
accounts is provided in the supplementary material, Section \ref{sec:collecting_the_data}). Headlines were
collected periodically, every hour, over the course of approximately
one year. In parallel, all the Twitter posts (called \emph{tweets})
were extracted about each news event using the public
API \cite{Twitter_API}.
%\footnote{\url{https://dev.twitter.com/} (Accessed: August 25,
%  2015.)},
% In this research, since we focus on the microblogging platform
% Twitter, we collected all the Twitter messages (called
% \emph{tweets}) produced about each news event using the publicly
% available Twitter Search API
based on a set of descriptive keywords extracted for each event. The
dataset is composed of $43,256,261$ tweets about events.
The descriptive keywords were automatically extracted from the
headlines using a variation of frequent itemset extraction
\cite{Tan_Steinbach_Kumar}. Figure~\ref{fig:components} illustrates an
example of an event showing the set of keywords and the tweets
associated with the event. These keywords form a semantically
meaningful event; they refer to the incident where soccer player Luis
Suarez was charged for biting another player during the FIFA World Cup
in 2014. Note that the collected set of social media posts associated to an event in this case is a
more exhaustive collection, encompassing several memes, viral tweets etc. about
the event when compared to existing studies
% \cite{Castillo:2014},\cite{Szabo:2010},\cite{Lerman:2010},\cite{Tatar:2011},\cite{Pinto:2013},\cite{Ahmed:2013,
% Zaman_information_spreading},\cite{suh2010want}
\cite{Castillo:2014,Szabo:2010,Lerman:2010,Tatar:2011,Pinto:2013,Ahmed:2013,Zaman_information_spreading,suh2010want}
which typically focus on simpler pieces of information (e.g., one particular meme, one viral tweet etc.).

% We validate the events in our data collection process to ensure that
% each group of social media posts corresponds to a meaningful news
% event by calculating several clustering metrics over its social
% media posts. The overall number of tweets obtained for all of the
% collected events was $43\,256\,261$. A good score on the clustering
% metrics indicates a good cluster. A detailed description of our
% collection methodology and how we construct cohesive events is
% provided in the supplementary material.
% Table~\ref{table:dataset-stats} shows a high level description of
% the dataset.


\begin{figure}
  %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/suarez_example-crop}
  \caption{\textbf{A representative event, collected on 2014-06-25
      with keywords (left) and sample user posts (right) collected
      from the Twitter Search API. Collected user posts contain at
      least one pair of keywords. }}
  \label{fig:components}
\end{figure}

The proposed model is based on the {\em vector quantization} of the
lengths of time intervals for the entire collection of events. This
approach is taken from the field of multimedia content analysis where
it is known as {\em codebook-based representation}, and used, for
example, in audio processing and computer vision~\cite{ff,Vaizman}.
After learning a codebook of the most representative time intervals,
each event is represented as a histogram where each bin corresponds to
one representative time interval.
% This represents an event as a vector.
The entries of the resulting vector are obtained as the percentage of
consecutive message pairs of the event that are assigned to the
corresponding bin, based on their arrival times.
This representation aptly and adequately captures the immediacy and
intensity of the reaction to the overall event. We call this
representation an \emph{impact-based event model.} Using this model,
we identify events as having a similar impact if their arrival time
intervals are similarly distributed, as that would imply a similar
intensity and immediacy of the overall reaction to the event. In
particular, we perform clustering on all the event vectors to identify groups with
similar distributions of their arrival time intervals. We sort the
resulting groups of events from highest to lowest impact, according to
the concentration of social media posts in the bins that correspond to
short time intervals. We consider the events that fall in the top few clusters 
to be high-impact as their associated social media posts have
the shortest arrival time intervals. 
These correspond to roughly 8\% of the events.
We consider the next few clusters
in the sorted ranking to form medium-high impact events, and so on.  Thus
we end with four groups of event histograms: high, medium-high, medium-low and low. 
Note that this way separating the
events is independent of the message volume
and the duration of the event, allowing us to identify local and global high-impact
occurrences.
% Results and Discussion can be combined.
\section*{Results and Discussion}
Figures~\ref{fig:highest} and~\ref{fig:low} show the average
histograms of the events in the high and low impact clusters, respectively.
Visually, high-impact event vector representations seem to follow an
exponential distribution. We test this hypothesis by fitting an
exponential function of the form $f(x)=ae^{bx}$ to the event
histograms. Figure~\ref{fig:param_est} shows two scatter
plots with the resulting exponential parameters $a$ and $b$. 
We observe that the majority ($97.4\%$) of
high-impact events have an exponent $b \leq -50$, separating them
unequivocally from other events.

% Further analysis of the top high-impact events shows that they

Further analysis of the high-impact events shows significant
differences to other events, in the following aspects: (i) how the
information about these events is propagated, (ii) the characteristics
of the conversations that they generate, and (iii) how focused users
are on the news topic. In detail, high-impact events have a higher
fraction of {\em retweets} (or shares) relative to their overall
message volume. On average, a tweet from a high-impact event is
retweeted 2.36 times more than a tweet from a low impact event. The
most retweeted message in high-impact events is retweeted 7 times more
than the most retweeted message in a medium or low impact event. We
find that a small set of initial social media posts are propagated
quickly and extensively through the network without any rephrasing by
the user (plain forwarding). Intuitively, this seems justified given
general topic urgency of high-impact events. Events that are not
high-impact did not exhibit these characteristics.

Our investigation also revealed that high-impact events tend to spark more conversation
between users, 33.4\% more than other events. This is reflected in the
number of {\em replies} to social media posts. The number of different
users that engage in high-impact events is 32.7\% higher than in
events that are not high-impact. Posts about high-impact events are
much more topic focused than in other events. The vocabulary of unique
words as well as {\em hashtags} used in high-impact events is much
more narrow than for other events. Medium and low impact events have
over 7 times more unique hashtags than high-impact events. This is
intuitive, given that if a news item is sensational, people will
seldom deviate from the main conversation topic.

% We have presented an analysis of high-impact news events based on
% the data of their entire life-cycle in the social network. We used
% the arrival time intervals to create a model that allows us to
% classify the event according to its impact. Nevertheless,

In a real-world scenario, in order to predict if an early breaking
news story will have a considerable impact in the social network, we
will not have enough data to create its impact-based model, i.e., we will not know yet the distribution of the speed at which the
social media posts will arrive for the event. For instance, an event
can start slowly and later produce an explosive reaction, or start
explosively and decay quickly to an overall slower message arrival
rate. Still, reliable early prediction of very high-impact news is
important in many aspects, from decisions of mass media information
coverage, to natural disaster management, brand and political image
monitoring, and so on.

We approach the early prediction task of high-impact events by using
machine learning algorithms over the early features of events. We use
event features that are independent of our impact-based model, such as
the retweets, the sentiment of the posts about the event, etc.
% More details are provided in the supplementary material.
This prediction task is carried
out independently of the number of social media posts about the event,
and the type of event (local or global). In our experiments, using off-the-shelf logistic regression,
we identify the high-impact events with 82\%
precision, using only the earliest 5\% of the data of each event.
Additionally, we were able to identify with high accuracy a
considerable percentage of all high-impact events ($\approx 46\%$)
at an early stage, with very few false positives. There were a total
of $5\,234$ events with 426 high impact events. We performed 5 fold
cross-validation with randomly selected 60\% training, 20\%
validation, and 20\% test splits.  We investigated the performance of
several classifiers for this prediction task, and discuss about the results
obtained from logistic regression.
% We used several classifiers to make predictions. We present the
% results from logistic regression in
%Tables~\ref{tab:confusion_matrix} and~\ref{tab:classification_results}
%present the data from logistic regression, encapsulating the
%prediction results from the early tweets, and the prediction results
%from all the tweets belonging to the event. 

The precision 
using only the early tweets is almost as much as using all
tweets in the event (0.819 to 0.830). This suggests that the social network somehow acts
as a natural filter in separating out the high-impact events fairly
early on.  The
recall goes from 0.455 to 0.540. This indicates that there are some
high-impact events which require more data in order to determine what
kind of impact they will produce, or events for which impact occurs
due to random conditions. A detailed description of the features and
different classification settings are provided in the supplementary
material.%\supplementary.




\section*{Conclusion}

We show that there are several properties that separate how
high-impact news events evolve in Twitter in comparison to other
events. We have created a model for events that allows us for an
unambiguous classification of high-impact events based on their impact
in the social network, in terms of the distribution of their
inter-message arrival rates. This definition avoids problems with
current notions of virality and popularity. Some characteristics of
high-impact events are that they are forwarded more often by users,
and generate a greater amount of conversation than other events.
Social media posts from high-impact news events are much more focused
on the news topic. Our experiments show that there are several
properties that can suggest early on if an event will have
high-impact on the on-line community. 
We can predict a high number of high-impact events {\em
  before} the network has shown any type of explosive reaction to
them. % Using simple off-the-shelf feature based classifiers, we can
% predict many high-impact events with high precision.
This suggests that users are collectively quick at deciding whether an event
is important or not.  However, there does exist a fraction of events
which will become high impact, inspite of not presenting patterns 
of other high impact events during their early stages.  These events
are likely to be affected by other factors, such as random conditions
found in the social network at the moment and require further investigation.
